Publications
------------

Please cite the following publication if you use the Beacon Calculus for your research: 

Boemo, M.A., Cardelli, L., Nieduszynski, C.A. (2020) The Beacon Calculus: A formal method for the flexible and concise modelling of biological systems. PLoS Computational Biology (In Press). [`Journal DOI <https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007651>`_] [`bioRxiv <https://doi.org/10.1101/579029>`_]

Formal Definitions
------------------

Note that this documentation presents the Beacon Calculus informally by way of examples in order to make the method accessible to non-specialists. Users looking for a more formal specification of the language's grammar and structural operational semantics are referred to the supplementary information of the above publication.

Bugs, Questions, and Comments
-----------------------------

Should any bugs arise or if you have any questions about usage, please raise a `GitHub issue <https://github.com/MBoemo/bcs/issues>`_. If you have comments or suggestions to improve the Beacon Calculus, the bcs software, or the documentation, please Email Michael Boemo at mb915@cam.ac.uk. Lastly, we are always keen to hear from biologists with an application in mind that would make for an interesting collaboration.
