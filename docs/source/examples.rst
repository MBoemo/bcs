Examples
===============================

New users are encouraged to look in the bcs/tests directory, which contains dozens of very simple models with the expected output and behaviour described in the comments.

We included examples from different fields of biology in the main `Beacon Calculus manuscript <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/579029v2>`_, which are:

* simple reaction between two chemical species (see section "Language Overview"),
* DNA replication in `S. cerevisiae` (see section "DNA Replication"),
* a population of cells responding to methylation damage (see section "Cellular Response to DNA Damage"),
* receptor multisite phosphorylation and ultrasensitivity (see section "Multisite Phosphorylation"),
* kinesin stepping down a microtubule (see Supplemental Information).

Full source code is provided for each of these examples, along with a line-by-line description of the processes and expected behaviour of the model.  For convenience, the source code for these models are provided in the bcs/examples directory, along with python scripts that create plots similar to those in the manuscript.

As we develop more applications and examples over time, we will post them here.
