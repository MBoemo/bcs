//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//process1 and process2 both offer handshakes
//process3 receives one or the other with equal probabilty and binds the parameter it received to x
//process3 offers a handshake with the parameter received, which is received by original process that sent the parameter

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -range operator
// -variable binding via handshake actions

//process definitions
process1[ i ] = {@launch![i], 10000}.{@launch2?[i], 1000}.{found1,1000};
process2[ i ] = {@launch![i], 10000}.{@launch2?[i], 1000}.{found2,1000};
process3[ i ] = {@launch?[1..10](x),x}.{@launch2![x], 1000};

//system line
process1[1] || process2[2] || process3[3];
