//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//Message is passed from proc2 to proc1, succeeding if gate and set arithmetic is correct
//longAction should happen on a much longer timescale than the short actions

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -arithmetic and boolean operations in gates
// -basic handshake functionality

//rate definitions
rateVar = 3.5;

//process definitions
proc1[j] = {priorAction,1}.{@chan![j],1}.{sent, 1};
proc2[] = {@chan?[0..50],1}.{received,1};

//system line
proc1[3] || proc1[5] || proc2[];
