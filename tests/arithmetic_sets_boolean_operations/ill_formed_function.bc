//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//all processes have one action, but each contains a function in the rate that is ill-formed
//we should get syntax errors and graceful exists from all of these

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -expression parser correctly detects ill-formed functions and throws the appropriate error

//test absolute value
proc1[] = {action1, abs(1,1)};
proc2[] = {action2, min(1,2,(,))};
proc3[] = {action3, max(1,)};

//system line
proc1[];
