//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//proc performs two actions, each of which will have a negative rate if the absolute value operator isn't working correctly
//the first rate should be 1.5 and the second rate should be 198

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -absolute value operation works correctly and integrates nicely with other arithmetic operations

//test absolute value
proc[ i ] = {action1, 2*abs(5-8)/4}.{action2,abs(2 - 5*5*(10 - 2))};

//system line
proc[0];
