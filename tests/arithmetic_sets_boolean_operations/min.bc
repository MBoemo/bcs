//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//proc1 performs three actions which incorporate min, max, and abs functions
//action1 rate should be 6, action2 rate should be 3, and action3 rate should be 100

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -absolute value operation works correctly and integrates nicely with other arithmetic operations
// -composite functions (where we have "1-60" within a "max", for instance) are working correctly

//test absolute value
proc1[] = {action1, min(6,12)/3+4}.{action2,max(min(3,7+4),8/3)}.{action3, min(abs(5-1000),100)};

//system line
proc1[];
