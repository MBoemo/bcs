//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//Should exit gracefully on discovering that the handshake receive in line 10 attempts to bind two received parameters to one binding variable (number of these must be equal)

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -safe variable binding
// -basic handshake functionality

//process definitions
proc1[i,j] = {@chan![i,j],1};
proc2[x,y] = {@chan?[x,y](a),1};

//system line
proc1[3,5] || proc2[6,3];

//>SyntaxError
