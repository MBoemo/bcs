//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//throw an error that proc has the wrong number of parameters

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -we should throw an error and gracefully exit if a process within a definition has been given the incorrect number of parameters

//definitions
proc[] = {action1, 1}.{action2, 1}.{action3, 1}.proc[i];

//system line
proc[];

//>SyntaxError
