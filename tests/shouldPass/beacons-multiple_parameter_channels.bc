//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//A beacon is launched by proc1 which cannot be received by proc2, followed by a beacon that proc2 can receive
//proc2 receives a beacon on the channel

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -channel names and processes with multiple values
// -the ability of parameters to function correctly as channel names

//definitions
proc1[ i, j ] = {i,2*j![i,j],3}.{i,j![i+1,(j+6)/3-2],3}.{sentChannelBeacon,2};
proc2[ i, j ] = {i,j?[i+1,j](x,y),0.1}.{shouldReceive,1};

//system line
proc1[1,2] || proc2[1,2];
