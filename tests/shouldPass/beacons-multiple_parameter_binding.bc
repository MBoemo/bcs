//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//A beacon is launched by proc1 which can be received by proc2
//proc2 receives a beacon on the channel

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -channel names and processes with multiple values
// -the ability of parameters to function correctly as channel names

//definitions
proc1[i, j] = {i,j![2*i+5,j*3],3}.{sentChannelBeacon,2};
proc2[i, j] = {4*i,j-1?[10..25 I 21,0..29 U 31..100 U 30](x,y),0.1}.proc3[x,y];
proc3[x, y] = {receivedByProc3,1};


//system line
proc1[8,10] || proc2[2,11];
