//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//A single process executes two processes in parallel - a handshake send and handshake receive 
//This handshake should be able to complete successfully and then the lone process should deadlock

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -splitting a process into two independent processes when we encounter a parallel operator

//process definitions
process[i] = {@msg![i],3} || {@msg?[i],2};

//system line
process[0];
