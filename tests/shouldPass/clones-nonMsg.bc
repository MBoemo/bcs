//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//run with debugging on simulator.cpp
//system processes should branch and clone as they go

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -clones are detected and grouped correctly with respect to non-messaging actions (and processes starting other processes)

P1[] = {action1, 1}.P2[];
P2[] = {action2, 1} + {action3, 1};

//system
3*P1[];
