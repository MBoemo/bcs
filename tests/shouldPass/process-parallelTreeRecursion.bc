//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//The model should be parsed correctly, but it should only perform action1 and action2

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -this is a unit test for parallel operators within System::sumTransitionRates

//test absolute value
proc[ j ] = [j==0] -> ({action1, 1}.{action2, 1} || {@handshake![0],1}.{@handshake![1],1});

//system line
proc[0];
