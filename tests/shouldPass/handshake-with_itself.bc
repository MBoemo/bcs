//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//A single process can make a choice between sending and receiving a handshake on the same channel.  No handshake should happen.

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -handshake candidates are correct with respect to the choice operator

//process definitions
process[i] = {@msg![i],3} + {@msg?[i],2};

//system line
process[0];
