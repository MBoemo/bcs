//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//proc2 launches a bunch of beacons, the last of which is killed by proc1 where it then shouldn't be able to be received

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -very basic functionality of B+ tree indexing
// -B+ tree deletion should work as expected

//process definitions
proc1[   ] = {@startProc1?[0],1}.{msg#[0], 1}.{msg?[0], 1}.{longAction,0.000001};
proc2[ j ] = [j > -1] -> {msg![j], 1}.{action1,1}.proc2[j-1]
           + [j == -1] -> {@startProc1![0],1};

//system line
proc1[] || proc2[1000];
