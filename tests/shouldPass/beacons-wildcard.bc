//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//Three beacons are very quickly sent on channel msg by proc1.
//The beacon receive by proc2 has a wildcard in its second argument such that it can bind values 1..3 as b and report the outcome

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -wildcard characters in beacon receives work as they should
// -variable binding
// -unbiased results on a three-way choice

//process definitions
proc1[] = {msg![1,3],1000}.{msg![1,2],1000}.{msg![1,1],1000};
proc2[] = {msg?[1,:](a,b),1}.( [b==1] -> {found1,1}
							 + [b==2] -> {found2,1}
							 + [b==3] -> {found3,1}
							 );

//system line
proc1[] || proc2[];
