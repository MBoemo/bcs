//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//Beacon is launched by proc2, which proc1 can receive if gate and set arithmetic is correct
//longAction should happen on a much longer timescale than the short actions

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -arithmetic and boolean operations in gates
// -complex arithmetic in beacon receive
// -basic beacon functionality

//process definitions
proc1[ j ] = {msg?[ 2 - 5*5*(j - 2)..20 ](y), max(4,2)}.{longAction,0.000001};
proc2[ j ] = [ (j == 3) | (j == 1) ] ->  {msg![ 2 - 5*5*(j - 2) ], 1}.( {action1,3.6} + {action2,5} );

//system line
proc1[3] || proc2[3];
