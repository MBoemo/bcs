//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//A beacon is launched by proc1 using parameter i as a channel name and then performs an action
//proc2 receives a beacon on a channel name equal to its parameter j, and if it does, it performs an action

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -processes with multiple parameters
// -the ability of parameters to function correctly as channel names

//definitions
proc1[ i, j ] = {i![j],1}.{sentChannelBeacon,1};
proc2[ i, j ] = {j?[i+1](x),1}.{shouldReceive,1};

//system line
proc1[1,2] || proc2[1,1];
