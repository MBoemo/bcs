//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//proc2 launches a bunch of beacons, the last of which should be received by proc1

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -very basic functionality of B+ tree indexing
// -B+ tree should be able to continually rebalance and so that the last beacon can still be efficiently received

//process definitions
proc1[ j ] = {msg?[0], 1}.{longAction,0.000001};
proc2[ j ] = [j >= -1] -> {msg![j], 1}.{action1,1}.proc2[j-1];

//system line
proc1[3] || proc2[1000];
