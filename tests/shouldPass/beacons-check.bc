//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//Beacon is launched by proc, which is not then received by proc because the parameter in the beacon check match the beacon launch
//longAction should happen on a much longer timescale than the short actions

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -arithmetic and boolean operations in gates
// -complex arithmetic for beacon parameters
// -basic beacon functionality

//process definitions
proc1[ j ] = [ (j == 3) | (j == 1) ] ->  {msg![2 - 5*5*(j - 2)], 1}.{~msg?[2 - 5*5*(j - 2)], 1}.{beaconCheckReceived,1};

//system line
proc1[3];

//255*j2neg-*-20..
