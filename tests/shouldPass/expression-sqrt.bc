//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//proc1 has two sequential actions that test sqrt and exponents
//action1 rate should be 9, action2 rate should be 6.32456

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -sqrt and exponential should cancel each other
// -generally makes sure sqrt and exp perform correctly

//test absolute value
proc1[] = {action1, sqrt(9)^2}.{action2,sqrt(10)*2};

//system line
proc1[];
