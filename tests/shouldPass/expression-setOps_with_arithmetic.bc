//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//A beacon is launched by proc2 and is received by proc1 if the set/arithmetic calculation is correct

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -combining set and arithmetic operations

testDef = 1;

//process definitions
proc1[ j ] = {msg?[ (j+1 U 8..10)\5 ], 4}.{longAction,0.000001};
proc2[ j ] = {msg![ j+1 ], testDef}.( {action1,3.6} + {action2,5} );

//system line
proc1[1] || proc2[1];
