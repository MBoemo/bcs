//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//graceful and informative exit on using functions as parameters/variables

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -if we have a function used as a variable in a gate with no trailing token, we give an informative exit

r = 1;

//process definitions
proc1[a,b] = {action2,r}.[i < max] -> {action3,r}.proc1[a+1];
proc2[a,b,c,max] = {action1,r}.proc1[a,b,max];

//system
proc2[1,2,3,4];
