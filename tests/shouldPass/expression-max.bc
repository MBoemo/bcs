//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//proc1 performs two actions, which mix max and abs operators
//proc2 will have a negative rate if max isn't working correctly
//action1 rate should be 4, action2 rate should be 35.5, and action3 rate should be 8

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -absolute value operation works correctly and integrates nicely with other arithmetic operations
// -composite functions (where we have "1-60" within a "max", for instance) are working correctly

//test absolute value
proc1[] = {action1, 2*max(5,8)/4}.{action2,max(abs(2 + 5/2*5*(1 - 4)),1)};
proc2[] = {action1, max(1-60,8)}; //this doesn't work right, it produces 1 60 8 - max which gives 58

//system line
proc1[] || proc2[] ;
