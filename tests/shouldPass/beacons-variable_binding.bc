//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//process1 and process2 both launch beacons
//process3 receives one or the other with equal probabilty and binds the parameter it received to x
//process3 offers launches a beacon with the parameter received, which is received by original process that sent the parameter

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -range operator
// -variable binding via beacon send/receive actions

//process definitions
process1[ i ] = {launch![i], 10}.{launch2?[i], 1}.{found1,100};
process2[ i ] = {launch![i], 10}.{launch2?[i], 1}.{found2,100};
process3[ i ] = {launch?[0..10](x),1}.{launch2![x], 1000};

//system line
process1[1] || process2[2] || process3[3];
