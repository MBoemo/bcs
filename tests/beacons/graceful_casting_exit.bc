//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//Similar to basic_beacons.bc but now a variable in the set calculation has been incorrectly entered as a double
//We should get a graceful and informative exit

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -graceful exists on beacon casting issues
// -casting issues are detected

doubleVar = 1.0;

//process definitions
proc1[ j ] = {msg?[ 2*doubleVar - 5*5*(j - 2) ], 4}.{longAction,0.000001};
proc2[ j ] = [ (j == 3) | (j == 1) ] ->  {msg![ 2 - 5*5*(j - 2) ], 1}.( {action1,3.6} + {action2,5} );

//system line
proc1[3] || proc2[3];
