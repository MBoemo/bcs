//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//A beacon is launched by proc and is subsequently received by proc
//proc then kills the beacon that it launched, so it shouldn't be able to do the second receive action (or the makeItHere action)
//if you delete the beacon kill, then you should be able to do makeItHere

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -beacons are killed and the database functions correctly

//process definitions
proc[ i ] = {msg![ i ], 1}.{msg?[ i ], 2}.{msg#[ i ], 3}.{msg?[ i ], 4}.{makeItHere, 5};

//system line
proc[0];
