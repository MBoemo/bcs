//EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
//A single process executes two processes in parallel - a beacon send and beacon receive 
//This exchange should be able to complete successfully and then deadlock

//WHAT IT TESTS:
// -splitting a process into two independent processes when we encounter a parallel operator
// -a beacon receive cannot happen until the appropriate beacon is pushed to the database

//process definitions
process[i] = {msg![i],3} || {msg?[i],2};

//system line
process[0];
